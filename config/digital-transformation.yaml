common_questions:
  - question: What is your vision of what our company will look like after digital transformation?
    response_template: My vision for digital transformation focuses on creating adaptive organizations that can continuously evolve with changing market conditions and technologies. This involves building modular technical architectures, developing digital capabilities in the workforce, implementing data-driven decision making, and creating a culture of continuous innovation. The end state isn't a fixed target but an organization with the capabilities to continuously transform itself.
  - question: Describe a significant digital transformation initiative you led and its outcomes.
    response_template: At Sygnum Bank, I led a comprehensive transformation from reactive to proactive infrastructure management in a regulated crypto-finance environment. This involved implementing ITIL principles, rebuilding the IT operations team, and creating a roadmap integrating Microsoft 365, Teams, DevOps, and Infrastructure-as-Code. The result was a significant improvement in operational efficiency while maintaining strict regulatory compliance.
  - question: How do you address resistance to change during transformation initiatives?
    response_template: I approach resistance to change by focusing on three elements clear vision communication, stakeholder involvement, and demonstrable value creation. At Habitusnet, I implemented a change management framework that included regular stakeholder workshops, pilot programs with key influencers, and metrics-driven success demonstrations. This approach has consistently helped overcome initial resistance by building understanding and ownership of transformation initiatives.
