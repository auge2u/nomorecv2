# NoMoreCV Platform Structure Analysis

## Project Overview

The NoMoreCV platform is an innovative approach to professional marketing that goes beyond traditional CVs. It focuses on demonstrating value through tangible evidence rather than self-promotion, with features including:

1. Multi-perspective data integration from various sources
2. Blockchain-based credential verification with zero-knowledge proofs
3. Intuitive persona trait input system
4. Dynamic output formats that adapt to different contexts
5. Career coach interview system using video and voice
6. Content distribution mechanism with tagging for external tools

## Current Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear architecture based on TypeScript, Supabase, and Cloudflare Workers:

## Key Components

### 1. Data Models

The platform has well-defined data models in `src/interfaces/models.ts` including:

- User - Platform user information
- Profile - Professional profile data
- Experience - Work experience entries
- Education - Educational background
- Project - Project portfolio entries
- Skill - Professional skills
- Trait - Persona traits and characteristics
- Verification - Credential verification records
- Content - Distributable content items
- Distribution - Content distribution records
- Interview - Career coach interview sessions
- Output - Formatted output presentations

### 2. Database Schema

The Supabase database schema in `supabase/schema.sql` includes:

- Tables for all data models with appropriate relationships
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data privacy
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Constraints for data integrity

### 3. Service Layer

The service layer includes implementations for:

- ProfileService - Managing user profiles and related data
- VerificationService - Handling credential verification
- ContentService - Managing content creation and distribution
- InterviewService - Handling interview sessions

### 4. API Layer

The API layer includes:

- Worker routing in `src/worker.ts` for handling API requests
- Profile API implementation in `src/api/profiles.ts`
- Placeholder implementations for other API endpoints

### 5. Cloudflare Workers

The platform uses Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions:

- Main worker entry point in `src/worker.ts`
- Durable Objects for stateful components like interview sessions
- Environment configuration in `wrangler.toml`

## Implementation Status

The following components have been implemented:

1. Project foundation with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest configuration
2. Core platform architecture with interface models and service implementations
3. Supabase database schema with tables, relationships, and security policies
4. Cloudflare Workers configuration with wrangler.toml
5. Initial codebase components including:
   - Durable Object for interview sessions
   - Worker routing and API handling
   - Utility functions for Supabase integration
   - Profiles API implementation
