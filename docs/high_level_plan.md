# High-Level Implementation Plan: "Help Them Discover You" Platform

This plan follows a dependency-driven approach, prioritizing foundational and core components before implementing features and integrations.

**Major Steps and Dependencies:**

1.  **Complete Foundational Backend (Phase 1):** Ensure the core project setup, infrastructure, authentication, database schema, and the basic API framework are fully implemented and stable. Profile Management backend should also be completed in this phase.
2.  **Develop Core and Feature Backend Services (Phase 2):** Implement the backend logic and APIs for the Persona Trait System, Output Format Generator, Content Distribution, Career Interview System, Verification System, and Analytics Engine. These have dependencies on the foundational components and each other as outlined in the dependency documentation. The Blockchain Connector should also be completed here.
3.  **Develop Frontend Component Library (Phase 3 - Parallel):** Build a reusable library of UI components. This can begin once the core infrastructure is in place.
4.  **Implement Integration Services (Phase 3):** Develop connectors for external APIs and the integration with the existing NOMORECV platform. These depend on the API framework and relevant core/feature backend services.
5.  **Implement Frontend User Interfaces (Phase 3):** Develop the complete user interface for the platform, utilizing the UI component library and connecting to all completed backend APIs and integration services. This is a major phase involving significant UI/UX work.
6.  **Establish DevOps and Observability (Phase 4 - Parallel):** Set up the CI/CD pipeline and monitoring/observability infrastructure. This can begin once foundational and API components are stable.
7.  **Refine and Optimize (Phase 4):** Focus on integrating analytics, implementing recommendation features, and optimizing the platform based on performance and user feedback.
8.  **Testing and Deployment:** Conduct comprehensive testing across all components and deploy the complete platform.

**Key Components to be Implemented/Completed:**

*   **Frontend:** The entire React with TypeScript frontend, including the UI Component Library and all user interfaces for profile management, CV editing, template customization, interview system, verification display, analytics dashboards, etc.
*   **Backend Services:**
    *   Completion of the Profile Management backend.
    *   Full implementation of the Persona Trait System backend and APIs.
    *   Full implementation of the Output Format Generator backend and APIs.

    *   Full implementation of the Verification System backend and APIs, including zero-knowledge proofs.
    *   Full implementation of the Analytics Engine backend and APIs.
    *   Implementation of the Blockchain Connector for the chosen blockchain (Sui, Solana, or Cardano).
    *   Implementation of External API Connectors (LinkedIn, GitHub, job boards, etc.).
    *   Implementation of the NOMORECV Integration.
*   **DevOps:** Establishment of the complete CI/CD pipeline and observability platform.

**Subsequent Subtasks for Delegation to Other Modes:**

*   **Code Mode:**
    *   Implementation of all backend services and APIs (WP6-WP7, WP9-WP14, WP15-WP16).
    *   Implementation of the Frontend User Interfaces, utilizing the component library.
    *   Implementation of the UI Component Library (in collaboration with UI/UX Designer mode).
    *   Setting up the DevOps pipeline and observability (WP17 and related tasks).
    *   Writing and executing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **Debug Mode:**
    *   Diagnosing and resolving issues identified during development and testing.
    *   Performance profiling and optimization.
*   **AI Guy Mode:**
    *   Development of the Persona Trait assessment engine and recommendation system.
    *   Development of the Career Interview intelligent question generation and content extraction.
    *   Development of the Analytics Engine and optimization recommendations.
    *   Implementation of NLP and ML models where required (e.g., CV Parsing, data inference).
