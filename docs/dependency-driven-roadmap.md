# Dependency-Driven Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a strategic overview of the "Help Them Discover You" platform implementation journey. Unlike traditional roadmaps that use fixed calendar dates, this approach focuses on dependency resolution and technical milestones. Progress is measured by component completion and dependency satisfaction rather than adherence to arbitrary deadlines.

## Roadmap Visualization

The following visualization shows the progression through major implementation milestones, driven by dependency resolution:

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using the following dependency-based metrics instead of time-based targets:

### 1. Component Completion Status

```mermaid
pie
    title "Component Completion Status"
    "Completed" : 0
    "In Progress" : 0
    "Blocked" : 0
    "Not Started" : 100
```

### 2. Dependency Resolution Rate

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Dependency Resolution Rate"
    x-axis "Milestone" ["M1", "M2", "M3", "M4", "M5", "M6"]
    y-axis "Dependencies Resolved (%)" 0 --> 100
    bar [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### 3. Critical Path Progress

Critical path components will be monitored closely as they represent the minimal sequence of dependencies that must be resolved to reach completion.

```mermaid

    classDef completed fill:#afa,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef inProgress fill:#fea,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef notStarted fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    DB[Database Schema] --> DAL[Data Access Layer]
    DAL --> UserSvc[User Service]
    UserSvc --> ProfileSvc[Profile Service]
    ProfileSvc --> CVSvc[CV Service]
    CVSvc --> CoreAPI[Core APIs]
    CoreAPI --> UI[User Interfaces]
    
    class DB,DAL,UserSvc,ProfileSvc,CVSvc,CoreAPI,UI notStarted
```

### 4. Dependency Blocking Analysis

This tracks components blocked by unresolved dependencies:

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Components Blocked by Dependencies"
    x-axis "Time" [" "]
    y-axis "Count" 0 --> 50
    bar [0]
```

## Implementation Streams

Multiple work streams will progress in parallel while respecting dependencies. The following streams will operate concurrently:

1. **Core Platform Stream**
   - Focus: Foundation and core services
   - Critical path: Yes

2. **Intelligence Stream**
   - Focus: CV parsing, analytics, recommendations
   - Dependencies: Core Services
   - Critical path: No

3. **Integration Stream**
   - Focus: External system connections
   - Dependencies: Core Services
   - Critical path: No

4. **Frontend Stream**
   - Focus: User interfaces and interactions
   - Dependencies: APIs from other streams
   - Critical path: Yes (final integration)

5. **DevOps Stream**
   - Focus: Infrastructure, CI/CD, observability
   - Dependencies: Minimal, mostly independent
   - Critical path: No

## Continuous Evolution 

The dependency-driven roadmap embraces continuous evolution rather than fixed releases:

### Feature Readiness Model

Features will be deployed when their dependencies are resolved and quality criteria are met, not according to predetermined release dates.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Identified
    Identified --> Prioritized: Dependencies analyzed
    Prioritized --> Ready: Dependencies resolved
    Ready --> InDevelopment: Development begins
    InDevelopment --> Testing: Implementation complete
    Testing --> Validated: Tests passed
    Validated --> Deployed: Deployment complete
    Deployed --> [*]
```

### Progressive Enhancement

The platform will follow a progressive enhancement approach, with each component adding value as it becomes available:

1. **Foundation First**: Core functionality before advanced features
2. **Incremental Intelligence**: Basic features before advanced ML capabilities
3. **Integration Layers**: Core integrations before specialized connectors
4. **UX Refinement**: Functional interfaces before advanced interactions

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All critical path dependencies have been resolved
2. Each milestone's acceptance criteria have been met
3. The platform delivers value to users at each stage of evolution
4. Technical quality meets or exceeds established standards
5. The architecture supports future growth and enhancement

## Conclusion

This dependency-driven roadmap provides a strategic framework for implementing the "Help Them Discover You" platform. By focusing on dependency resolution rather than calendar-based milestones, the roadmap enables a more flexible and realistic approach to development while ensuring that technical prerequisites are properly addressed.

The implementation will proceed through clearly defined milestones, with progress tracked based on completed components and satisfied dependencies. This approach allows for parallel development streams while maintaining the integrity of the overall architecture.
