# Work Package Documentation for Specialist LLMs

This document provides detailed instructions for specialist LLMs to continue development of the NOMORECV platform. Each work package is designed to be developed independently once its dependencies are met, enabling parallel development.

## Overview

The NOMORECV platform is an innovative approach to professional marketing that goes beyond traditional CVs. It focuses on demonstrating value through tangible evidence rather than self-promotion, with features including:

1. Multi-perspective data integration from various sources
2. Blockchain-based credential verification with zero-knowledge proofs
3. Intuitive persona trait input system
4. Dynamic output formats that adapt to different contexts
5. Career coach interview system using video and voice
6. Content distribution mechanism with tagging for external tools

The platform is built using:
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Supabase for database and authentication
- Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions and edge computing
- React for the frontend (to be implemented)

## Current Project Status

The following components have been implemented:

1. Project foundation with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest configuration
2. Core platform architecture with interface models and service implementations
3. Supabase database schema with tables, relationships, and security policies
4. Cloudflare Workers configuration with wrangler.toml
5. Initial codebase components including:
   - Durable Object for interview sessions
   - Worker routing and API handling
   - Utility functions for Supabase integration
   - Profiles API implementation

5. Address review comments before merging

### Testing

1. Write unit tests for all components using Jest
2. Aim for at least 80% test coverage
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Mock external dependencies for isolated testing
5. Run tests before committing changes

## Handoff Process

When completing a work package, follow this handoff process:

1. Ensure all requirements are met
2. Verify that all tests pass
3. Document any implementation details or decisions
4. Create a pull request with a detailed description
5. Complete the handoff checklist in the PR description
