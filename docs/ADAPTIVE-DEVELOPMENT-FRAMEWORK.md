# Adaptive Development Framework

## Overview

The Adaptive Development Framework (ADF) is a dynamic approach to software development that enables teams to shift between specialized modes (architecture, coding, UI/UX, DevSecOps) based on development phase needs while maintaining cohesive progress toward user-centric goals. This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing and utilizing the Adaptive Development Framework for the "Help Them Discover You" platform.

## Core Principles

1. **Mode-Driven Development**: Deliberately shifting between specialized modes to optimize development activities
2. **Interface-First Design**: Establishing clear interfaces before implementation details
3. **Continuous Validation**: Validating work against user requirements at each stage
4. **Cohesive Progress**: Maintaining clear connections between all development activities
5. **Ethical Considerations**: Integrating ethical considerations throughout the development process

## Mode Transitions

### Transition Process

1. **Completion Verification**: Ensure all requirements of the current mode are completed
2. **Transition Planning**: Identify the reason and timing for the mode transition
3. **Artifact Documentation**: Document all artifacts created during the current mode
4. **Transition Execution**: Formally transition to the new mode using the ModeCoordinator
5. **Kickoff**: Begin activities in the new mode with a clear focus on next steps

### Transition Triggers

| From | To | Common Triggers |
|------|----|--------------------|
| Architecture | Coding | Core interfaces defined and validated |
| Architecture | UI/UX | User flows and interface needs identified |
| Coding | UI/UX | Implementation ready for user interface |
| Coding | DevSecOps | Feature implementation complete |
| UI/UX | Coding | Interface designs ready for implementation |
| UI/UX | Architecture | User needs require architecture changes |
| DevSecOps | Architecture | New system capabilities needed |
| DevSecOps | Coding | Operational issues need code changes |

## Implementation

The Adaptive Development Framework is implemented through several key components:

### 1. ModeCoordinator Service

The `ModeCoordinator` service manages the current development mode and transitions between modes. It tracks:

- Current active mode
- Requirements for each mode
- Transition history
- Completion status

```typescript
// Example: Transitioning from architecture to coding mode
import modeCoordinator from '@/services/framework/ModeCoordinator';

modeCoordinator.transitionTo(
  'coding',
  'Core interfaces defined and ready for implementation',
  'Development Team',
  ['data-models.ts', 'api-contracts.md', 'component-interfaces.md']
);
```

### 2. Mode Requirements Management

Each mode has specific requirements that must be completed before transitioning to another mode:

```typescript
// Example: Updating requirement status in the current mode
modeCoordinator.updateRequirementStatus(
  2, // Requirement index
  true // Completed
);
```

### 3. React Integration via useModeCoordinator Hook

React components can access and manipulate the mode coordinator using the `useModeCoordinator` hook:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useModeCoordinator } from '@/hooks/useModeCoordinator';

function ModeStatus() {
  const { currentMode, requirements, isCompleted } = useModeCoordinator();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Current Mode: {currentMode}</h2>
      <p>Status: {isCompleted ? 'Ready for transition' : 'In progress'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Mode Coordinator Panel

The `ModeCoordinatorPanel` component provides a visual interface for:

- Viewing the current mode
- Checking requirement completion status
- Transitioning between modes
- Viewing transition history
- Adding custom requirements

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ModeCoordinatorPanel } from '@/components/framework/ModeCoordinatorPanel';

function DevelopmentDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Development Dashboard</h1>
      <ModeCoordinatorPanel />
    </div>
  );
}
```
