## Dependency Resolution Framework

### Dependency Types

1. **Hard Dependencies**: Must be resolved before work can begin
   - API contracts before implementation
   - Data models before database schema
   - Authentication framework before security implementation

2. **Soft Dependencies**: Can be worked around temporarily
   - UI implementation with mock data
   - Backend services with mock responses
   - Integration tests with mock external systems

3. **Notification Dependencies**: Require awareness but not blocking
   - Performance impact changes
   - Schema evolutions
   - API version deprecations

### Dependency Management Process

```mermaid

    [*] --> IdentifyDependencies
    IdentifyDependencies --> CategorizeDependencies
    CategorizeDependencies --> Hard
    CategorizeDependencies --> Soft
    CategorizeDependencies --> Notification
    
    Hard --> ResolveBlockers: Must resolve before proceeding
    Soft --> ImplementTemporaryWorkarounds: Can proceed with mocks
    Notification --> DocumentAndCommunicate: Proceed with awareness
    
    ResolveBlockers --> TrackDependencyStatus
    ImplementTemporaryWorkarounds --> TrackDependencyStatus
    DocumentAndCommunicate --> TrackDependencyStatus
    
    TrackDependencyStatus --> [*]
```

### Dependency Resolution Workflow

1. **Dependency Identification**
   - During task planning
   - Through architectural reviews
   - Via cross-team communication

2. **Dependency Documentation**
   - Explicit dependency listing in tasks
   - Dependency graphs for complex features
   - Automated dependency tracking where possible

3. **Resolution Strategies**

   - Mock implementations
   - Progressive integration
   - Feature toggles

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Dependency resolution status in task management
   - Blockers highlighted in daily standups
   - Dependency-based critical path analysis

## Communication Protocols

### Synchronization Mechanisms

1. **Interface Definition Repository**

   - Version-controlled specifications
   - Automated validation and testing

2. **Cross-Domain Working Groups**
   - Regular synchronization meetings
   - Focused on interface boundaries
   - Representation from dependent teams

3. **Dependency Resolution Board**
   - Prioritization of blocking dependencies
   - Resource allocation for critical path items
   - Escalation path for delayed dependencies

### Documentation Standards

1. **Interface Contracts**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs
   - GraphQL schema for GraphQL APIs
   - TypeScript interfaces for component props
   - JSON Schema for data models

2. **Technical Decision Records**
   - Standard format for architecture decisions
   - Explicit listing of dependencies and impacts
   - Approval workflow based on dependency scope

3. **Integration Documentation**
   - Sequence diagrams for cross-domain workflows
   - Component diagrams showing dependencies
   - Data flow diagrams for complex processes

## Conclusion
