# NOMORECV Platform - Project Handoff

This document provides all the information needed to continue development of the NOMORECV platform. The project has been structured for parallel development by multiple specialist LLMs, with clear work packages and dependencies.

## Project Overview

The NOMORECV platform is an innovative approach to professional marketing that goes beyond traditional CVs. It focuses on demonstrating value through tangible evidence rather than self-promotion, with features including:

1. Multi-perspective data integration from various sources
2. Blockchain-based credential verification with zero-knowledge proofs
3. Intuitive persona trait input system
4. Dynamic output formats that adapt to different contexts
5. Career coach interview system using video and voice
6. Content distribution mechanism with tagging for external tools

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```

## Technology Stack

The platform uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (to be implemented)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 and Supabase Storage
- **Video**: Cloudflare Stream
- **Blockchain**: Sui, Solana, or Cardano (to be implemented)
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages and Workers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- VSCode with recommended extensions
- Supabase account
- Cloudflare account

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values
4. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the schema.sql file in the SQL Editor
5. Set up Cloudflare:
   - Create a new Cloudflare Workers project
   - Configure wrangler.toml with your account details
6. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

The project is designed for parallel development by multiple specialist LLMs. Each work package can be developed independently once its dependencies are met.

### Work Packages

See `work_package_documentation.md` for detailed information on each work package, including:
- Requirements
- Dependencies
- Specialist assignment
- Deliverables
- Technical details

### Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch for each work package
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3. Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
4. Submit pull requests for review when features are complete
5. Address review comments before merging

## Current Implementation Status

The following components have been implemented:

1. Project foundation with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest configuration
2. Core platform architecture with interface models and service implementations
3. Supabase database schema with tables, relationships, and security policies
4. Cloudflare Workers configuration with wrangler.toml
5. Initial codebase components including:
   - Durable Object for interview sessions
   - Worker routing and API handling
   - Utility functions for Supabase integration
   - Profiles API implementation

## Next Steps

The following work packages are ready for implementation:

1. WP9: Persona Trait System (assigned to LLM-4)
2. WP10: Output Format Generator (assigned to LLM-3)
3. WP11: Content Distribution (assigned to LLM-4)
4. WP12: Career Interview System (assigned to LLM-3)
5. WP13: Verification System (assigned to LLM-4)
6. WP14: Analytics Engine (assigned to LLM-4)
