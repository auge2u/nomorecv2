# NOMORECV Blockchain Validation Approach

## Overview

This document details the blockchain validation approach for the NOMORECV platform, focusing on how blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will be implemented to provide verifiable, privacy-preserving validation of professional skills, achievements, and capabilities.

## Core Requirements

1. **Privacy Protection**: Ensure user data remains private while enabling selective verification
2. **Verifiable Credentials**: Provide tamper-proof validation of professional claims
3. **User Control**: Give users complete control over what information is shared and verified
4. **Interoperability**: Enable verification across organizational boundaries
5. **Scalability**: Support growing user base and credential volume efficiently
6. **Usability**: Make the verification process intuitive for both issuers and verifiers

## Blockchain Selection Analysis

After careful evaluation of the three blockchain options (Cardano, Solana, and Sui), we recommend the following approach:

### Recommended Primary Platform: Sui

**Rationale**:
- **Object-centric model**: Sui's object-centric data model aligns perfectly with credential-based verification
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scalability supports growing credential volume without performance degradation
- **Move language**: Provides strong safety guarantees critical for credential verification
- **Low latency**: Near-instant finality enables real-time verification experiences
- **Developer momentum**: Growing ecosystem with strong focus on identity and credential use cases

**Key Advantages for NOMORECV**:
1. The object-centric model allows each credential to be a distinct object with its own permissions and properties
2. Dynamic fields enable extensible credentials that can evolve over time
3. Parallel execution enables high throughput for credential issuance and verification
4. Move's strong type safety reduces vulnerability risks in credential handling
5. Low gas fees make credential issuance and verification economically viable

### Alternative Options

#### Cardano
- **Strengths**: Formal verification, academic rigor, sustainability focus
- **Limitations for NOMORECV**: 
  - Lower transaction throughput could limit scalability
  - Smaller developer ecosystem for identity solutions
  - More complex development environment

#### Solana
- **Strengths**: High throughput, established ecosystem, low transaction costs
- **Limitations for NOMORECV**:
  - Account-based model less ideal for credential objects
  - Network stability concerns during high load
  - Less optimal for complex zero-knowledge proof implementations

## Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

### ZKP Technology Selection: zk-SNARKs

We recommend implementing zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) for the following reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: Compact proof size and fast verification
2. **Non-interactivity**: Proofs can be verified without interaction with the prover
3. **Succinctness**: Small proof size makes on-chain verification practical
4. **Maturity**: Well-established libraries and implementation patterns

### Implementation Approach

1. **Circuit Design**:
   - Create specialized circuits for different verification types:
     - Skill possession verification
     - Experience duration verification
     - Achievement validation
     - Education credential verification
   - Implement parameterized circuits for flexible verification scenarios

2. **Trusted Setup**:
   - Implement a multi-party computation (MPC) ceremony for the trusted setup
   - Document the setup process for transparency
   - Consider periodic setup refreshes for long-term security

3. **Proof Generation**:
   - Client-side proof generation to maintain data privacy
   - Optimization for browser and mobile environments
   - Progressive enhancement for devices with limited computational capacity

4. **On-chain Verification**:
   - Implement efficient on-chain verifiers on Sui
   - Optimize gas costs for verification operations
   - Create verification registry for proof status tracking

## Credential Architecture

### Credential Types

1. **Skill Credentials**:
   - Technical skills with proficiency levels
   - Soft skills with contextual evidence
   - Domain expertise with scope definition

2. **Experience Credentials**:
   - Role-based experience with duration
   - Project participation with contribution scope
   - Achievement recognition with impact metrics

3. **Education Credentials**:
   - Formal education with institution verification
   - Certifications with expiration handling
   - Continuous learning with progress tracking

4. **Impact Credentials**:
   - Quantifiable outcomes with measurement methodology
   - Peer recognition with weighted validation
   - Value creation with attribution mechanisms

### Credential Structure

Each credential will be implemented as a Sui object with the following structure:

```move
struct Credential has key, store {
    id: UID,
    credential_type: String,
    subject_did: String,
    issuer_did: String,
    issuance_date: u64,
    expiration_date: Option<u64>,
    revocation_status: bool,
    credential_status: String,
    credential_schema: String,
    proof: CredentialProof,
    // Dynamic fields for credential-specific attributes
}

struct CredentialProof has store {
    type: String,
    created: u64,
    verification_method: String,
    proof_value: vector<u8>,
    proof_purpose: String,
}
```

### Credential Lifecycle

   - Revocation checking before presentation

4. **Verification**:
   - On-chain verification of credential status
   - Cryptographic validation of issuer signature
   - Zero-knowledge proof verification
   - Verification result with confidence level

5. **Revocation**:
   - Status update on revocation registry
   - Notification to credential holder
   - Grace period for credential updates
   - Revocation reason documentation

## Decentralized Identity Integration

## Privacy-Preserving Verification Flows

### Selective Disclosure

1. **Attribute-Based Disclosure**:
   - Select specific credential attributes to disclose
   - Generate proofs for selected attributes only
   - Maintain unlinkability between disclosures
   - Support derived attributes (e.g., "over 3 years experience" without revealing exact duration)

2. **Predicate Proofs**:
   - Implement range proofs for numerical attributes
   - Support threshold proofs for qualification levels
   - Enable set membership proofs for categorical attributes
   - Implement comparison proofs for relative attributes

### Verification Scenarios

1. **Skill Verification**:
   ```
   User -> Verifier: "I have expert-level Python skills"
   Verification Process:
   1. User selects Python skill credential
   2. User generates ZKP proving "skill level >= expert" without revealing exact assessments
   3. Verifier checks proof validity and credential status on-chain
   4. Verification result returned with confidence level
   ```

2. **Experience Verification**:
   ```
   User -> Verifier: "I have led teams of 10+ people"
   Verification Process:
   1. User selects leadership experience credentials
   2. User generates ZKP proving "team size >= 10" without revealing exact team size or context
   3. Verifier checks proof validity and credential status on-chain
   4. Verification result returned with confidence level
   ```

3. **Impact Verification**:
   ```
   User -> Verifier: "I have delivered projects with >$1M impact"
   Verification Process:
   1. User selects project impact credentials
   2. User generates ZKP proving "impact value > $1M" without revealing exact figures
   3. Verifier checks proof validity and credential status on-chain
   4. Verification result returned with confidence level
   ```
